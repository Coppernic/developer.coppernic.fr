Getting started
===============

On Coppernic's Android products, a service is installed that allow user application to perform special tasks on device. On first generation
of Coppernic's products it is called `CpcSystemServices`, on second generation, it is called `CoreServices`.

**First generation products**

- C-Cone
- C-One e-ID
- C-five

**Second generation products**

- C-One²
- C-One² e-ID
- ID Platform

If there is no `CpcSystemServices` or `CoreServices`, then Coppernic's samples will not work as expected.

These applications are available on [F-Droid](fdroid.md).

Once service is installed, [samples](https://github.com/Coppernic) can work.

Now, let's see how to add Coppernic's libs on your [build](build.md).
